This file maps each file available in the Ubuntu
system to the package from which it originates.  It includes packages
from the DIST distribution for the ARCH architecture.

You can use this list to determine which package contains a specific
file, or whether or not a specific file is available.  The list is
updated weekly, each architecture on a different day.

When a file is contained in more than one package, all packages are
listed.  When a directory is contained in more than one package, only
the first is listed.

The best way to search quickly for a file is with the Unix `grep'
utility, as in `grep <regular expression> CONTENTS':

 $ grep nose Contents
 etc/nosendfile                                          net/sendfile
 usr/X11R6/bin/noseguy                                   x11/xscreensaver
 usr/X11R6/man/man1/noseguy.1x.gz                        x11/xscreensaver
 usr/doc/examples/ucbmpeg/mpeg_encode/nosearch.param     graphics/ucbmpeg
 usr/lib/cfengine/bin/noseyparker                        admin/cfengine

This list contains files in all packages, even though not all of the
packages are installed on an actual system at once.  If you want to
find out which packages on an installed Debian system provide a
particular file, you can use `dpkg --search <filename>':

 $ dpkg --search /usr/bin/dselect
 dpkg: /usr/bin/dselect
